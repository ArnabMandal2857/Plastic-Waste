                        <p class="answer" id="q1a">
                        <b>Plastic Waste</b> is the accumulation of plastic objects and particles in the environment. It can adversely affect <i>humans</i>, <i>wildlife</i>, and their <i>habitats</i>.<br>
                        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also refers to the significant amount of <b>plastic</b> that is <b>not recycled</b> and ends up in <b>landfill</b> or, in the developing world, thrown into <b>unregulated dump sites</b>. In the UK, for example, over <b>5 million tonnes of plastic</b> is consumed each year and yet only <b>1 quarter</b> of it is <b>recycled</b>. The <b>three quarters that isn't recycled</b> enters our <b>environment</b>, polluting our <b>oceans</b> and <b>causing damage to our ecosystem</b>.<br>
                        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less developed countries, the <b>majority of plastic</b> waste eventually ends up in the <b>ocean</b>, meaning that marine animals are especially at risk.<br>
                        <br><em>Reducing plastic consumption and raising awareness about plastic recycling is crucial if we are to overcome the problem of plastic waste and pollution on our planet.</em>

                        <p class="answer" id="q2a">Plastic is a polymeric material whose molecules are very large, often resembling long chains made up of a seemingly endless series of interconnected links.<br>
                        <br>Nowadays, an average consumer comes in contact with all types of plastic materials that have been developed specifically to defeat natural decay processes. The plastics made from petroleum can be molded, cast, spun or applied as a coating. Since the plastic are largely non-biodegradable, they tend to persist in the nature forever.

                        <p class="answer" id="q3a">Plastic wasn't invented until the late 1800s and the production of plastic didn't take off until around 1950. But then it really took off. Since 20<sup>th</sup> century, we have become more depended on plastic as an affordable, durable and long-lasting material. The world has produced over 9 billion tons of plastic since then and TWO THIRDS have ended up in the environment - including our oceans. Plastic are a non-degradable in nature ant the plastics that has been dumped in the landfills, oceans etc. still exist, and we are still producing more of it.<br>
                        <br> This counter shows the number of lastic bags that has been produced this year.

                        <br><p class="answer">Isn't it fascinating that the figures are changing so fast? Yes it is but we have to stop the increase of this number.<br>
                        <br>But we have to keep in mind that there are still plastic present in landfills and in nature. these plastics has to go somewhwere. These plastics are either carelessly dumped in the ocean, rivers and lakes. In place of producing more plastic, we can reuse the plastic that has already been produced and still persist in nature.</p>

                    <li class="fourth"><h3 class="question" id="q4">Plastic in the oceans, rives and lakes. What is it causing?</h3>
                        <p class="answer">Since ocean is the downstream of nearly every terrestrial location, it becomes a recieving body for most of the plastic waste developed on land. Plastics are generally throw plastics in rivers and lakes which eventually flow towards the river and end up in the ocean.<br>
                        <br>Maybe the land gets rid of the plastic waste produced, but what about the oceans or other water bodies?<br>
                        They look something as shown in the below given image.</p>

                        <p class="answer">Like this, several tons and millions of plastic waste is dumped in the worls's ocean every year. A <a class="live" href="#counter" style="color:antiquewhite;" >live counter</a> at the start of the page shows the total amount of plastic dumped in the ocean every year. The first oceanographic study was published in 2014 that estimated the amount of near-surface plastic debris in the worlds ocean. The result was an estimate of drastic 5.2 trillion plastic particles that weighed around 244,000 metric tons.</p>
                        <h3 class="answer" id="q4s1">What is plastic causing to marine life?</h3>
                        <p class="answer" style="padding-left: 35px;">According to <b>United Nations</b>, at least 800 species around the globe are affected by plastic debris.<br>
                        <br>These animals even die as they get entangled in objects such as fishing gears, they also die as they ingest the plastic objects mistaken for food. Studies have found that all kinds of species, including small zooplankton, large cetaceans, most seabirds, and all marine turtles, ingest plastic bits and trash items such as plastic bags, bottle caps etc.<br>
                        <br>The seawater ans sunlight makes the plastic brittle over time ant plastic gets broken down into microplastic which are then consumed by more aquatic animals specially the smaller ones.</p>

                        <p class="answer">Plastic waste or debris also have some terrestrial aspects. Due to poor dispose of plastic materials, the Drainage system gets clogged with plastic bags, films and other items, causing flooding. Plastic also dosen't allow rainwater to seep into ground and causes problem for the trees to get grounwater. It also causes hindrance to the refill of the ground-water level. As plastic is dosposed off carelessly in the environment, it cause problems to the ground animals also. Animals ssuch as dogs, cats, cows, goats etc. in search of food sometimes consume plastic which causes problem in their digestive tract.</p>

                        <p class="answer">Nowadays, we have become very dependent on plastic materials as a very cheap, durable and light-weight object for carrying and storing objects. But the usage of hese objects shoule be minimised as it creates so much chaos in nature.</p>
                        <ol class="answer">We can use the below given steps to reduce plastic waste to some extent.<br>
                            <li class="stoppage">We should use plastic as less as possible.</li>
                            <li class="stoppage">We should avoid disposable plastic cutlery, plastic straws, and other single-use plastics.</li>

                        <p class="answer" style="font-size: 25px;" id="q6s1"><b>The 3 R's Rule</b></p>
                        <p class="answer">We should keep in mind the <b>3R's rule</b> which stands for <b>Reduce</b>, <b>Reuse</b> and <b>Recycle</b>, its is a way to take care of the environment by generating less waste, saving money and being a more resposible consumer.<br>
                        The most important is the recycling, and it is true that it is very important, but it is also important to generate less rubbish and waste whic is the work of the first two R's: Reduce and Reuse.<br>
                        <br>A lot of waste is still lying around the nature or goes to landfill which eventually become a source of pollution and environmental degradation.</p>

                                <h3 class="answer" style="font-size: 25px;" id="q6s2">The first R: Reuse</h3>
                                <p class="answer" style="padding-left: 40px;">Reusing items has always been done in our houses such as younger siblings recieving clothes from older ones, saving the empty galss jam container to make pickles or store spices.<br>
                                We have always beeen reusing the items which are possible to be reused and not only once but multiple times.<br>
                                Same applies in case of plastic. Any plastic article which can be reused such as water bottles, shopping bags etc. should be reused. In addition there are many industries which collect and fix the wasted plastic material and make it ready for reuse.</p>
                                
                                <h3 class="answer" style="font-size: 25px;" id="q6s3">The second R: Reduce</h3>
                                <p class="answer" style="padding-left: 40px;">As the name suggests that we should reduce the usage of plastic and mainly reducing the over-consumption and the waste we produce is fundamental to sustainable develpoment. Redducing means buying less when it is noot necessary, reducing the consumption, reducing the amount of packaging.</p>
                                <br>

                                <h3 class="answer" style="font-size: 25px;" id="q6s4">The third R: Recycle</h3>
                                <p class="answer" style="padding-left: 40px;">The most fundamental part of the  3R's rule is the recycle. It specifies that separating waste correctly and recycling it is the only option we have if care about the future of our planet earth. The word recycling implies returning someting to the cycle of its life.
                                <br>We can also recycle plastic by disposing it properly which will cause lesser production of plastics.</p>

                        <p class="answer" style="font-size: 23px;"><b>Separating the recyclable waste from biodegradable waste</b></p>
                        <p class="answer" style="padding-left: 40px;">The most common way to dispose plastic properly is to seperate it from the other biodegradable waste. For this, we can throw the waste by separating it. We have always seen two dustbins together in public areas one of green color and other of blue color.<br><br>Now, why are both of these dustbins kept together?<br><br>Its kept together to seperate the recyclable waste and biodegradable waste from each other.<br><br><b>The Blue Dustbin</b><br>The blue dustbin is meant for the throwing recyclable waste such as cardboard, magazines, food tin, plastc bottles etc.<br><br><b>The Green Dustbin</b><br>Green dustbin is meant for the purpose of throwing biodegradable waste such as food items, vegetable peels, cotton, tea leafs etc.</p>

                        <p class="answer">Many initiatives has been take by both governmental and private institutions to prevent plastic wastage. In our country, Government has started <b>Swacch Bharat Abhiyaan</b> to reduce the amount of waste in our surroundings which mainly include plastic waste.
                        <br><br>Many private instutions and companies has reduced the amount of plastic usage in their business.

                        <p class="answer">There are many ways in which plastuc can be used. We can recycle it to make new plastic products out of the pre-existing plastic present in the nature. But how can we use it more effectively?</p>
                        <h3 class="question" style="padding-left: 20px;">The Plastic Roads:</h3>
                        <p class="answer" style="padding-left: 40px;">Plastic roads are the type of roads that are made entirely or partially from plastic composites with other materials. Plastic roads are entirely different from that of the standard roads. The standard roads are mmade out of asphalt concrete, which consists of a mineral aggregate and asphalt, while plastic roads are made of plastic. Plastic for these roads generally come fron the plastic waste.<br>
                        <br>Plastic roads were first developed by <b>Rajagopalan Vasudevan</b> in 2001, consisting of an asphalt mix incorporating plastic waste. The usage of plastic in making road can recyle the post consumer plastics in an innovative way. Countries such as Australia, Indonesia, United Kingdoms, United States of America and may more have tested the technologies that can incorporate plastic into asphalt mix.</p>
                        <h3 class="answer" style="padding-left: 40px;"><u>Initial Developments of Plastic Roads:</u></h3>
                        <p class="answer" style="padding-left: 80px;">Rajagopalan Vasudevan of the Thiagarajar College of Engineering developed and patented a technique for constructing roads using waste plastics. He was awarded the Padma Shri, one of India's highest honors, in 2018 for his research on plastic reuse. The process involves collecting various types of waste plastics, cleaning them, shredding them to a uniform size, and melting them at 165°C. This melted plastic is then mixed with hot aggregates and bitumen to create a unique mixture used as a primary component in road construction.</p>
                        <h3 class="answer" style="padding-left: 40px;"><u>Construction:</u></h3>
                        <p class="answer" style="padding-left: 80px;">Plastic roads, a novel concept, are being constructed in various ways across the world. In places like Jamshedpur, India, and several areas in Indonesia, roads are being built using a mix of plastic and bitumen. The construction process involves collecting and managing plastic waste, primarily from product packaging materials like polyethylene terephthalate (PET or PETE), polypropylene (PP), and high- and low-density polyethylene (HDPE and LDPE). These materials are sorted, cleaned, dried, shredded, and then melted at around 170°C. Hot bitumen is added to the melted plastic and mixed. This mixture is then laid as with regular asphalt concrete. However, no country has yet adopted a large-scale, systematic approach to build roads entirely of plastics. In September 2018, a Dutch company, Volkerwessels, constructed a bicycle path made of recycled plastic in Zwolle, Netherlands. A second path is planned in Giethoorn in Overijssel, and Rotterdam is likely to adopt the technology.</p>
